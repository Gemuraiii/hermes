## So this project is my baby.
## The purpose of this project is to create an extension/application that will be release for web use. It will be user accessible, possibly go from there
## The function of the application is simple but complex.
## It will be a research assistant - the main audience will be Med students, Students pursuing Academia, Data Miners, Data engineers, researchers, PhD students, etc
  - But that will not mean it is not useful to the every day web surfer
## So the main body is a function
  This function is to take an input ( a Keyword, a link, a Title, etc) and search the web for links, files, etc that match/relate to that input
  - It would then save to your local file in the form of a Notepad, CSV file or Table that will outline the HTML link, pdf, csv, doc files in your local directory
  - Additionally I would like it to become available for Cloud use - where the information found would be store on Google Cloud or AWS
  
- Additionally, I want toi add a filter based on creditibility, which sites are rated as professional and information is trusted/valid
- I would like to add a Anti-virus scan to ward off any potential security breaches that would come from downloading these links and files
 -- A lot of moving parts
## I can share my bookmarks of the research that I have done so far and this is by no means a time project. It is supposed to be fun and expansive at its core
At some point I would like to actually make this into a downloadable application but I believe the best step is to start it as an extension for Google Chrome or Safari.
## There will need to be some work with UX/UI on how the extension looks but I believe that is more front-end work that can be done when the backend is functioning as it should
## There will be a need to learn Python and possibly C++, any other languages you feel would move this project along use and run it by me as well.
## front-end work will involve Javascript, HTML, CSS as well
I would love for this to actually get off the ground, possibly make some money off of it as well. Nice come up for our 20s
SO LETS HAVE FUN.
